# US-Election-Data-Exploration-and-Predicting-2016-Elections

This project is an attempt to build a predictive model that is capable of predicting the 2016 US presidential elections. The model is trained on election data from 2008 and 2012.
The dependent variables are the percentage vote shares of each parties and independent variables include a variety of factors ranging from race, eductaion, crime rate and so on. The limitation of this model is that the same independent variables are used to train the 2008 and 2012 data.
This project flows through data cleaning/preparation, data exploration and predictive modeling.
